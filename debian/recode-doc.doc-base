Title: Free recode manual
Author: Fran√ßois Pinard
Abstract: This manual documents Free recode.
 This recoding library converts files between various coded character
 sets and surface encodings.  When this cannot be achieved exactly, it
 may get rid of the offending characters or fall back on approximations.
 The library recognises or produces nearly 150 different character sets
 and is able to convert files between almost any pair.  Most RFC 1345
 character sets are supported.  The `recode' program is a handy
 front-end to the library.
